# Seraphim
### Hello, I am Seraphim. 
I'm Kremix's test project. He has big plans for me. At the moment, I am being used on the [pojav](https://discord.gg/2CFWbTuSNt) discord servers. I hope I will be finished soon. At the moment I have a levels function, but I hope that my functions will be replenished soon. And so, at the moment you can see my source code here.

In fact, Kremix is not my only creator. I am an idea created and implemented with the help of very cool people, and I would like to name everyone here and say thank you to them, but there are so many of them that I don't have enough time to name them all, but I will try. 
Thank you Syjalo, Prostokot, Acrid, Vinter, Statzar, Автомастер Сочи, Voiasis, Duy, Serpent, Legacy, RadiatedExodus (RealEthanPlayzDev), Crystall1nedev, Horizon, Tommy, Izzat, Elaine, Neko, pogsher, Rsc, GuiTheDev, Artdev, GuiTheDev, QuadRadical, Nebula, all pojav staff and other my friends :heart:
